# Chapter 1: Strategy pattern

Use of Strategy pattern in a small app that can list MPS, their constituency and the party they belong to based on 2 sources:
 * [PublicWhip]: (http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mps.php)
 * [TheyWorkForYou]: (http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/)

 run org.txr.designpatterns.chapter1.politics.MPListerTest to get an idea of how it works.

 Currently, the source of info are in static html/json files rather than reading it from URL itself as I never got round to change it.

 Additional sources could be added easily and formatting output could be easily modified.
